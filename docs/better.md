# Bolt Project Improvement Recommendations

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Plugin System (from TaskWeaver)
- Implement a plugin architecture for extensibility
- Benefits:
  - Modular code organization
  - Easier testing and maintenance
  - Dynamic loading of new capabilities
- Key features to adopt:
  - Plugin schema validation
  - Auto plugin selection based on context
  - Plugin documentation generation

### 2. Multi-Agent Patterns (from Multi-Agent-Orchestrator)
- Implement cost-efficient routing pattern
  - Route requests to appropriate model tiers based on complexity
  - Optimize for both performance and cost
- Add multi-lingual support
  - Language-specific agents
  - Automatic language detection and routing
- Consider agent specialization
  - Task-specific agents
  - Domain expertise separation

### 3. Error Handling (from Agent-Zero)
- Enhance error capture and recovery
- Implement automatic error detection
- Add self-healing capabilities
- Provide detailed troubleshooting guides

## Development Experience

### 1. Documentation Improvements
- Add cookbook with common patterns
- Include troubleshooting guides
- Document architecture decisions
- Provide plugin development guides

### 2. Testing Framework
- Implement comprehensive test coverage
- Add integration tests between brain regions
- Create performance benchmarks
- Add behavior validation tests

### 3. Development Tools
- Add CLI-only mode for rapid development
- Implement hot-reloading for plugins
- Create development environment containers

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Performance Tracking
- Add metrics collection
- Implement performance monitoring
- Track resource usage
- Monitor API latencies

### 2. Debugging Tools
- Add context inspection tools

- Create debugging dashboards

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Container Execution (from TaskWeaver)
- Run code in isolated containers
- Implement security boundaries
- Add resource limits
- Monitor container health

### 2. Access Control
- Implement role-based access
- Add API key management
- Implement rate limiting
- Add audit logging

## AI/ML Improvements

### 1. Model Selection
- Implement dynamic model selection
- Add fallback mechanisms
- Support multiple model providers
- Optimize for cost/performance

### 2. Memory Management
- Implement vector store integration
- Add caching mechanisms
- Optimize memory usage
- Add memory consolidation

## Next Steps Priority

   - Foundation for future improvements
   - Enables community contributions

2. Container Security
   - Critical for production readiness
   - Enables safe code execution
   - Improves isolation

3. Multi-Agent Routing
   - Optimizes resource usage
   - Improves response quality
   - Enables specialization

4. Monitoring System
   - Essential for production
   - Enables performance optimization
   - Facilitates debugging
