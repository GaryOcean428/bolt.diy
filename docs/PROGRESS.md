# Project Improvement Progress

## Current Status (2024-12-30)

### ‚úÖ Completed

1. **Documentation Infrastructure**
   - Created models.md for LLM model documentation and selection criteria
   - Established progress tracking system

2. **Multi-Agent System Implementation**
   - Created specialized agent architecture
   - Implemented base SpecializedAgent class with team coordination
   - Added core agents (Architect, CodeReview, Security)
   - Added extended agents (Testing, Documentation, Research, Memory)
   - Implemented agent communication protocol with pub/sub pattern
   - Added support for consensus building
   - Integrated all agents with AgentManager

3. **Memory Systems Implementation**
   - Implemented VectorStore using ChromaDB for semantic search
   - Added ShortTermMemory using Redis for caching
   - Created LongTermMemory with PostgreSQL for persistent storage
   - Built MemoryManager to coordinate all memory systems
   - Added memory association system for linking related data
   - Integrated necessary dependencies

4. **Plugin System Implementation**
   - Implemented a robust plugin system with the following features:
      1. **Plugin Architecture**
         - Enhanced plugin types with capability levels and lifecycle hooks
         - Implemented base plugin class with validation and lifecycle management
         - Created plugin registry with dependency management

      2. **Core Features**
         - Plugin lifecycle management (load, unload, initialize, cleanup)
         - Capability-based access control
         - Dependency management and validation
         - Configuration schema validation
         - Event-based communication

      3. **Plugin Capabilities**
         - Basic: Read-only operations
         - Standard: Basic mutations
         - Advanced: Complex operations
         - System: System-level operations

      4. **Lifecycle Hooks**
         - `onLoad`: Called when plugin is loaded
         - `onUnload`: Called when plugin is unloaded
         - `onAgentInitialize`: Called when an agent is initialized
         - `onAgentDispose`: Called when an agent is disposed
         - `onBeforeTask`: Called before an agent executes a task
         - `onAfterTask`: Called after an agent completes a task

      5. **Example Implementation**
         - Created LoggingPlugin as a reference implementation
         - Demonstrates proper plugin structure and hook usage
         - Includes configuration validation and file logging capabilities

### üèóÔ∏è In Progress

1. **Security Enhancements**
   - Container execution system
   - Access control implementation
   - Security scanning integration

2. **Development Experience**
   - Testing framework setup
   - Development tools implementation
   - Hot-reloading system

3. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Metrics collection system
   - Performance monitoring
   - Debugging tools

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order

1. Plugin System (Foundation for extensibility)
2. Multi-Agent System (Core functionality)
3. Memory Systems (Support for advanced features)
4. Security (Critical for production)
5. Development Experience (Developer productivity)
6. Monitoring (Operational excellence)

### Key Metrics

- Code coverage percentage
- Documentation completeness
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scan results

## Next Steps

1. Implement additional core plugins:
   - State management plugin
   - Error handling plugin
   - Performance monitoring plugin
2. Add plugin discovery and auto-loading
3. Implement plugin marketplace integration
4. Add plugin versioning and compatibility checks
5. Start agent system enhancement
   - Define agent roles
   - Design communication protocol
   - Implement basic team structure
